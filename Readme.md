8 completed Exercises from the ECE 537 course focus on data analysis and statistical pattern recognition background by exploring specific issues and concerns that commonly arise concurrently and interdependently with real-world datasets. The dataset is not included.


# Focuses for each exercise are as follows:
1. Generating Gaussian Dataset and Data classes
2. Bayesian Classification: A prior probabilities, Loss functions, and impacts of outliers on decision boundaries
3. Implementation of neural networks and their decision boundaries.
4. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA and Fisher Discriminant
5. Unbalanced Dataset
6. Data Normalization
7. Feature Correlation and mutual information
8. Time-series Data: Denosing, spurious data, Discontinuities, and Event Detection
